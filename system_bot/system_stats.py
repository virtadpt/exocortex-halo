# system_stats.py - Module that implements all of the system statistic
#   collection and reporting parts of system_bot.py.

# License: GPLv3

# v4.3 - Fixed a bug in Fahrenheit to Centigrade conversion.  Oops.
#       - Added a utility function get_disk_space(), which returns the amount
#       of disk space used by a mount point.
#       - Fixed a bug in which disk space usage alerts didn't get rounded off.
# v4.2 - Added support for getting the local date and time.
#       - Added OpenWRT support for local date and time.
# v4.1 - Added support for OpenWRT with a separate module.
# v4.0 - Ported to Python 3.
# v3.3 - Added a Centigrade-to-Fahrenheit utility function.
#      - Added a function that periodically checks the current temperature
#        of every sensor on the system and sends an alert to the user if
#        the temperature reaches what the driver considers a dangerous or
#        critical point.
#      - Renamed disk_usage() to get_disk_usage() because it conflicted
#        with a variable name elsewhere.
#      - Made check_memory_utilization() configurable.
# v3.2 - Changed "disk free" to "disk used," so it's more like the output of.
#        `df`.
# v3.1 - Added function to get the local IP address of the host.
# v3.0 - Added real statistics support.
# v2.2 - Added function to get public IP address of host.
#      - Added function that gets network traffic stats.
# v2.1 - Added system uptime.
# v2.0 - Refactoring code to split it out into separate modules.
# v1.0 - Initial release.

# TO-DO:
# - Optimize the temperature monitoring loop for the general case.

# Load modules.
