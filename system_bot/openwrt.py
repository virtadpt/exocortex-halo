# openwrt.py - Module that makes it possible to use Systembot to monitor a
#   node running OpenWRT (https://openwrt.org/) when it's not feasible to do
#   a full install of Halo to it due to a lack of disk space.  This module
#   implements as many of the usual system monitoring features as possible
#   in as compatible a way as possible.  This module is not active by default.

# License: GPLv3

# v1.2 - Added local time and date support.
# v1.1 - Added CPU counting support.
#      - Added CPU idle time support.
#      - Added disk usage support.
# v1.0 - Initial release.  Bare minimum for functional parity with regular
#   system monitoring (i.e, everything that's monitored automatically.)

# TO-DO:
# - temperature?
# - top?
# - system time
