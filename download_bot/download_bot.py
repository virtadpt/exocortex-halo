# download_bot.py - Bot written in Python that, when given a URL to a file
#   through its message queue, downloads it into a globally specified directory
#   for storage.
#
#   This is part of the Exocortex Halo project
#   (https://github.com/virtadpt/exocortex-halo/).

# License: GPLv3

# v2.3 - Cleaned up a little formatting.
#      - Added yt-dlp support because youtube-dl is dead.
# v2.2 - Reworked the startup logic so that being unable to immediately
#        connect to either the message bus or the intended service is a
#        terminal state.  Instead, it loops and sleeps until it connects and
#        alerts the user appropriately.
#      - Changed some print()ed output to logging.fatal().
#      - Changed logger.warn() to logger.warning().
#      - Changed how errors are reported to the user so they're more
#        transparent (though still fatal (which may not be optimal)).
# v2.1 - Added user-definable text to the help and about-to-do-stuff parts.
#      - Changed the default polling time to 10 seconds, because this bot
#        won't be run on a Commodore 64...
#      - Broke the online help out into a separate function.
#      - Got tired of unescaped spaces in filenames, added HTML unescaping.
# v2.0 - Ported to Python 3.
# v1.2 - Added "download this as an MP3" support.
# v1.1 - Added youtube-dl support.
# v1.0 - Initial release.

# TO-DO:
# - Write a better command parser, because this is getting bad.
