# globals.py - A Weather Station Bot module that implements global variables
#   shared across other modules.  It would probably be best practice to pass
#   them around as arguments to methods in other modules but that would make
#   the argument lists unwieldly.  This way is easier to maintain and debug.

#   This is part of the Exocortex Halo project

# v1.0 - Initial release.
