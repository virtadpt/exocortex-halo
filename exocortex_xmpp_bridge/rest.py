# rest.py - This module implements the REST API part of
#   exocortex_xmpp_bridge.py.
#
#   This is part of the Exocortex Halo project
#   (https://github.com/virtadpt/exocortex-halo/).

# v5.0 - Reworking for Python 3.
# v4.0 - Refacted bot to break major functional parts out into separate modules.
# v3.0 - Rewriting to use SleekXMPP, because I'm tired of XMPPpy's lack of
#        documentation.  The code is much more sleek, if nothing else.
#      - Refactored the core message processing method to split out the
#        common stuff (online help and status reports) into helper methods.
# v2.2 - Added a universal API rail '/replies' so that bots can send replies
#        to their user over XMPP by hitting their configured XMPP bridge over
#        HTTP.
# v2.1.1 - Started pulling 'search' out of text because this bot is used for
#        much more than just web searches.
# v2.1 - Working on the "goes into a coma and pegs the CPU problem" by adding
#        XEP-0199 client-to-server pings to keep the server alive.
#      - Added online help to the command parser.
# v2.0 - Rewrote using xmpppy (http://xmpppy.sourceforge.net/) because it's
#        more lightweight than SleekXMPP and hopefully has fewer interactions.
#        Also, if I need to, I should be able to drop nbXMPP
#        (https://python-nbxmpp.gajim.org/) in with minimal code modification.
#      - Added some code that lets the bot interact more with its owner to
#        provide feedback.  I got tired of having to read the logs to see what
#        was going on, okay?
#      - Renamed a bunch of stuff because I tore out the old XMPPBot and wrote
#        a new class from scratch.  It made it easier to keep track of in my
#        head... until I did so, in fact, I had a hard time rewriting this
#        bot.
# v1.1 - Switched out OptionParser in favor of argparse.
#      - Refactored the code to make a little more sense.  argparse helped a
#        lot with that.
#      - Reworked logging a little.
#      - Declared variables at the tops of everything for maintainability.
#        Having to deal with a phantom variable that pops out of nowhere is
#        kind of annoying.
#      - Setting SleekXMPP to "block=True" makes it easier to kill from the
#        command line.
#      - Set the default loglevel to INFO.
# v1.0 - Initial release.

# TODO:
# - Write a signal handler that makes the agent reload its configuration file
#   (whether it's the default one or specified on the command line).
# - Consider adding a SQLite database to serialize the message queues to in
#   the event the microservice ABENDs or gets shut down.  Don't forget a
#   scream-and-die error message to not leave the user hanging.
# - Maybe add a signal handler that'll cause the bot to dump its message queues
#   to the database without dying?
# - Figure out how to make slightly-mistyped search agent names (like all-
#   lowercase instead of proper capitalization, or proper capitalization
#   instead of all caps) match when search requests are pushed into the
#   message queue.  I think I can do this, I just need to play with it.
