# globals.py - A Web Search Bot module that implements a couple of global
#   variables.
#
#   This is part of the Exocortex Halo project
#   (https://github.com/virtadpt/exocortex-halo/).

# v1.0 - Initial release.
#       - Broke a bunch of stuff out into this module because they get used
#       everywhere and using them as parameters was making it hard to keep
#       things tidy.
